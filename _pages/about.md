I am an engineer and researcher at heart, building solutions to complex problems who discovered almost two decades ago that Data Science could be used with great success during international humanitarian aid assistance. Since then, I am incredibly fortunate to provide an expertise in GIS, data science and Deep Learning to a wide range of international organisations deploying decision support systems during crisis responses.
